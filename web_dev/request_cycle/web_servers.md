Pulled from the article above, here are some of the major key ideas behind Linux:

1. Small is Beautiful
2. Each Program Does One Thing Well
3. Prototype as Soon as Possible
4. Choose Portability Over Efficiency
5. Store Data in Flat Text Files
6. Use Software Leverage
7. Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leverage and Portability
8. Avoid Captive User Interfaces
9. Make Every Program a Filter

Linux was built with the idea that the user should be able to run any command they want to, whether it's good or bad. There is a lot of flexibility in what ways you can perform an action in Linux, which is another important part of their philosophy. It's an open source software, meaning that you will be able to benefit from the previous work of other programmers.
