# Make a method called 'encrypt' that advances every letter of a string one letter forward.
# Input and output can both be lowercase.
# Leave space character as a space instead of converting it.

# For each letter in a string, use 'next' to shift each letter to the next in alpha order.
# For each space, do nothing to that space.
# For example, 'the cat meows' would become 'ugf dbu nfpxt'
