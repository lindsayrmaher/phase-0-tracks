# Pseudocode a sorting method that takes an array of integers and uses a sorting algorithm, and returns a sorted version of the array. 
#** Not Ruby-specific.

# INSERTION SORT

# Start with an unsorted array.
# Create an empty 'final array' in which to feed the sorted values.
# Insert the first value into the final array.
# Insert the second value into the final array at the point where it is greater than all the values before it.
# Repeat for each value in the unsorted array.
# Return the final array. All values should be in numeric order.
# If the unsorted array were: [90, 56, 71, 25, 19, 0, 2, 68]
# Then the final array would be: [0, 2, 19, 25, 56, 68, 71, 90]

  # deletes input_array[0] from input_array (so it's cutting and pasting instead of copy and pasting)
