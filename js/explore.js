// In comments, pseudocode a function that takes a string as a parameter and reverses the string.
// Need a string variable to work with - the parameter
// Create a loop that will go through each letter of the string
// Want to start at the end of the string and work backwards
// Maybe make a new string to add the letters to as it loops (somewhere to store the characters of the inputted string)
// return the new variable in the function so that we can print it when we run the function

function reverseString(inputString) {
	var newString = "";
}
