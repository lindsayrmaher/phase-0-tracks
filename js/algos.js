// Practicing Javascript Algorithms

// First Drill
// Return the longest word of the array

// Want to run through each word in the array and compare lengths
// IF the word length is longer than the word after it, move it to the end (index -1)
// OR IF the word is shorter than the word before it, move it in front of that word
// OTHERWISE keep it in the same position
// Once all the words have been sorted, return the last word of the array (should be longest)
